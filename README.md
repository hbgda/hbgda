# Notable Projects
## Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered
I'm the lead developer of the [Spider-Man Multiplayer](https://discord.gg/pGpTqCkQMC) project, a long-term project built from scratch to re-implement cut multiplayer functionality. This includes the development of entirely custom native UI integration and modding tools built from scratch.

## Marvel's Spider-Man 2
I've created several "script" mods for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, including the highly popular RageSettings mod, and the ModSettings library that gives developers the ability to create entirely custom native menus within the game.
